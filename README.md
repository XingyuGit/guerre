## Development Environment
To set up your dev environment, you'll need to install the following tools:

### 1. Node.js (with NPM)
```
$ brew update
$ brew install node
```

### 2. Bower
[Bower](http://bower.io) is a front-end package manager that make life supes easy.
```
$ npm install --global bower
```

### 3. Gulp
[Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) is a "streaming build system" that automates compilation and building your projects.
```
$ npm install --global gulp
```

### 4. Clone this repository
Pick your favorite directory and run:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/aaronpanch/guerre.git
```

### 5. Install Dependencies
Navigate to the root of the project `cd guerre` and run:
```
$ npm install
$ bower install
```

## 6. Start the Server (last step!)
```
$ gulp serve
```
Your default browser should open to `localhost:9000` and you're ready to code!
